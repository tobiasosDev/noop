// MARK: - Caffeine window (#526) — log an intake + a rough on-device "still active" estimate
//
// OPT-IN, MANUAL-FIRST: the user logs a caffeine intake (a time, and OPTIONALLY an amount in mg). NOOP
// then shows a plain "caffeine still active" hint on Today / Insights, computed entirely on-device from a
// simple exponential half-life decay. This is a ROUGH GUIDE from what the user logged, NOT a measurement
// and NOT a health claim — caffeine pharmacokinetics vary a lot between people (the ~5–6 h half-life is a
// population average). The honest framing lives in the copy; the math here just decays what was logged.
//
// Storage mirrors the native-journal pattern (UserDefaults-backed, single user). Nothing leaves the
// device. Default state is EMPTY (no intakes) — the feature surfaces nothing until the user logs one.

/// Pure caffeine half-life decay math. Headless — no I/O, no UI — so it's fully unit-tested.
///
/// Model: the fraction of a dose remaining after `t` hours is `0.5 ^ (t / halfLifeHours)` (first-order
/// elimination, the standard pharmacokinetic approximation). With multiple intakes the remaining amounts
/// simply add. The default half-life is 5.5 h — squarely in the commonly-cited ~5–6 h adult range — and
/// is exposed so the value is never a magic number.
