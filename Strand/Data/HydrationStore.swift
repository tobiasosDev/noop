// MARK: - Hydration tracker (MVP) — opt-in, local-only water logging
//
// The user logs water with three quick taps (Sip 30 ml / Cup 237 ml / Bottle 500 ml). The day TOTAL is
// banked in the generic metric-series tall table under a dedicated source/key — the SAME `metricSeries`
// table + `upsertMetricSeries` path every other generic daily series uses (no schema change). Because the
// table holds one row per (deviceId, day, key), a tap reads the day's running total and re-upserts
// total + amount, so the stored value IS "the sum of today's hydration logged for this local day".
//
// This is the BYTE-PARITY twin of the Android `com.noop.analytics.HydrationStore`: identical source id
// ("hydration"), identical key ("hydration"), identical additive-accumulation logic, identical 7-day
// history projection (one row per local calendar day, 0 for empty days, oldest first). Per-tap timestamps
// are intentionally NOT persisted on either platform — the day total is the source of truth and the MVP
// detail shows the honest day figure. Everything stays on-device; nothing is synced.
