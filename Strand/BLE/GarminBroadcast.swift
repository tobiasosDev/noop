/// stream. They DO broadcast the STANDARD Bluetooth Heart Rate profile (0x180D / 0x2A37) when the user
/// turns on "Broadcast Heart Rate" on the watch. So Garmin live HR is the EXISTING generic-HR path
/// (`StandardHRSource`) — there is nothing Garmin-proprietary to implement, and we don't pretend there is.
///
/// This type therefore carries only:
///   • recognition (delegated to `ExperimentalBrand`), and
///   • the user-facing hint to enable Broadcast HR (the one thing that makes the watch discoverable on
///     0x180D).
/// A Garmin device is registered with `sourceKind: .liveBLE` so the SourceCoordinator already runs it
/// through `StandardHRSource` — no new BLE driver is needed, and the WHOOP/standard paths are untouched.
