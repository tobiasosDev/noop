// computation here. DailyMetric and CachedSleepSession mirror the server's daily_metrics /
// sleep_sessions tables and are cached locally so History = union(phone-collected raw streams,
// server-computed derived metrics). ServerSync.pull() populates this cache; MetricsRepository
// reads it for the view layer.

/// One cached sleep session pulled from the server's /v1/sleep. Natural key (deviceId, startTs).
/// `stagesJSON` is the verbatim JSON array of stage segments ([{start,end,stage}]) — stored as a
/// string so the cache stays schema-agnostic about the staging shape.
