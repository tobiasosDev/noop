// SleepStager.swift — sleep/wake detection + APPROXIMATE 4-class staging.
//
// Ported from server/ingest/app/analysis/sleep.py and sleep_features.py.
//
// HONEST HEDGING: these stages are APPROXIMATIONS, not PSG-validated, not medical
// advice. The EEG-free 4-class ceiling is ~65–73% epoch agreement (Walch 2019).
// Light/deep separation is the weakest link — deep-minute estimates are the least
// reliable output.
//
// Pipeline (30 s epochs):
//   Stage 0  gravity-stillness sleep/wake spine → in-bed sessions. Cole–Kripke
//            (te Lindert 30 s) computed as a citable cross-check; HR confirms runs.
//   Stage 1  per-epoch cardiorespiratory features over a rolling 5-min window
//            (mean HR, DoG-HR variability, RMSSD/SDNN from RR, resp rate + RRV).
//   Stage 2  transparent percentile-band classifier → {wake, light, deep, rem}.
//   Stage 3  median smoothing + physiology re-imposition (no early REM, deep in
//            the first third of the night).
//
// NOTE: the Python source computes RMSSD/SDNN/HF/LF/LFHF via neurokit2 per epoch.
// On-device we have no neurokit2/scipy, so frequency-domain features (HF, LF/HF)
// are omitted and the parasympathetic-tone signal is RMSSD only. Respiration rate
// + RRV are derived from the raw 1 Hz resp channel with a simple peak detector
// (the Python source explicitly derives these "robustly ourselves" too, so this
// path is a faithful port rather than an approximation). The classifier seam,
// percentile bands, smoothing, and physiology rules are reproduced exactly.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// TODO (staging-accuracy roadmap — after the 1.72 deep/REM fix). The 0%-deep bug
// is closed; these are the next genuine accuracy gains, in value/effort order.
// All on-device, no GPU, no model blob unless noted. The EEG-free ceiling is
// ~65–73% epoch agreement (Walch 2019), so tune to approach it, don't chase past.
//
//   1. HMM / Viterbi smoothing (Stage 3) — HIGHEST VALUE, no training data.
//      Today: each epoch is classified in isolation (classifyOne) then majority-
//      smoothed (smoothLabels) + hard physiology rules (reimposePhysiology).
//      Replace/augment with a Viterbi pass over a 4×4 stage transition matrix so
//      implausible jumps (e.g. wake→deep direct) are forbidden and noise is
//      denoised by sequence likelihood, not a 5-epoch vote. Emission probs can be
//      derived from the same percentile bands. Pure CPU, deterministic.
//
//   2. Poincaré SD1/SD2 (+ pNN50) as per-epoch features — CHEAP, on-target.
//      SD1/SD2 is the geometric form of the "HRV regularity" that separates deep
//      (low SD1/SD2, tight) from REM (scattered) — exactly the deep/REM seam this
//      stager keys on. Just RR math (no scipy): SD1=√(½·SDSD²), SD2=√(2·SDNN²−½·SDSD²).
//      Add to EpochFeatures + feed classifyOne. LF/HF would need an on-device FFT
//      (no scipy) — defer; SD1/SD2 captures most of the same regularity signal.
//
//   3. Validate/tune against the user's OWN labelled nights — DO REGARDLESS.
//      ~204 official-WHOOP nights (deviceId `my-whoop`, ≈deep 23% / REM 24%) are a
//      noisy-but-real personal label set. Use RealNightValidationTests as the
//      harness to tune the percentile-band constants (stageHR*Pct etc.) to THIS
//      user's physiology instead of literature defaults — or to fit a small
//      per-user calibration.
//
//   4. Gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost/LightGBM) classifier — DEFER until 1–3 done.
//      Likely beats hand-tuned bands, BUT needs a labelled-PSG training pipeline
//      (Walch ~31 nights), ships a model artifact, and loses the current
//      interpretability — for marginal gain under the EEG-free ceiling. Low
//      priority; revisit only if 1–3 plateau below the WHOOP baseline.
//
// Keep the Android twin (android/.../analytics/SleepStager.kt) in lockstep on any
// of these, same as the 1.72 fix.
