// WeeklyDigest.swift — a deterministic, offline "week in review".
//
// Pure, deterministic, DB-free. Given the daily series for each tracked metric
// (keyed by "yyyy-MM-dd"), this builds a Monday-anchored "this week" summary:
//
//   • per-metric this-week SeriesStat (mean / median / min / max / SD / slope),
//   • week-over-week PeriodComparison (this week vs the immediately preceding
//     Mon–Sun week), reusing ComparisonEngine.compare,
//   • a "vs baseline" delta: this-week mean against a trailing baseline mean
//     (the prior `baselineWeeks` complete weeks before this one),
//   • a sleep-consistency read (SD of the night's values across the week — lower
//     is steadier),
//   • a strain-vs-recovery balance read (is Effort outrunning Charge this week?),
//   • the 1–3 biggest movers ranked by normalised week-over-week change, and
//   • 1–2 plain-English focal points, rendered the way BehaviorInsights.sentence
//     renders an effect.
//
// It deliberately consumes plain [String: Double] day→value maps (not a DB row
// type) so StrandAnalytics stays decoupled from WhoopStore: the UI layer pulls
// recovery/strain/sleep/RHR/HRV out of its own DailyMetric shape and hands them
// in. No AI is required — narration is an optional later layer that can take this
// struct as input.
//
// Week math is timezone/locale-free: weekday is computed from the "yyyy-MM-dd"
// string with a pure Sakamoto/Zeller day-of-week, and week windows are produced
// as inclusive "yyyy-MM-dd" string ranges, so the split matches the day strings
// AnalyticsEngine emits exactly (string comparison is chronological for ISO days).
