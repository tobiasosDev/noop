// RecoveryScorer.swift — resting HR during sleep + a transparent 0–100 recovery score.
//
// Ported from server/ingest/app/analysis/recovery.py.
//
// recovery() is a z-score + logistic composite. It is APPROXIMATE — not
// WHOOP-identical (WHOOP's model is proprietary). It is a transparent,
// HRV-dominant, baseline-normalized proxy.
//
// Weighting (documented, grounded, explainable; this is "Charge" in the UI):
//   higher HRV vs baseline       → higher recovery  (W_HRV       = 0.55, dominant)
//   lower resting HR vs baseline → higher recovery  (W_RHR       = 0.20)
//   higher rest quality (sleep)  → higher recovery  (W_SLEEP     = 0.15)
//   lower resp vs baseline       → higher recovery  (W_RESP      = 0.05)
//   skin-temp deviation from 0   → lower recovery   (W_SKIN_TEMP = 0.05)
//
// The Charge/Effort/Rest redesign folds skin temperature in (illness/overreach
// signal): HRV dropped 0.60 → 0.55 to make room for W_SKIN_TEMP = 0.05. The
// skin-temp term is a SYMMETRIC penalty on the ±°C deviation (−|dev|/scale), so any
// drift away from the personal baseline — hot or cold — lowers Charge. It is added
// ONLY when a skin-temp deviation is supplied; when nil the term drops and the
// weights renormalize, leaving the no-skin-temp score IDENTICAL to before.
//
// Each metric is standardized to a robust z-score against the personal baseline
// (mean + EWMA-abs-dev spread). Missing terms are dropped and the weights
// renormalized. The composite z is squashed through a logistic anchored so that
// Z = 0 → ~58% (WHOOP's published population-average recovery).
//
// Cold-start: if the HRV baseline (dominant driver) is not yet usable
// (< MIN_NIGHTS_SEED valid nights), recovery() returns nil. Callers may use
// RECOVERY_POPULATION_MEAN (58.0) as a fallback but should flag it.
