/**
 * Data-access for the local store. Mirrors the GRDB reads/writes in WhoopStore
 * (StreamStore.swift, Reads.swift, MetricsCache.swift).
 *
 * Stream inserts use OnConflictStrategy.IGNORE == Swift `ON CONFLICT(...) DO NOTHING`
 * (idempotent by natural key — re-inserting an existing row is a no-op).
 *
 * Server-derived caches (dailyMetric, sleepSession, metricSeries) use @Upsert so the
 * latest server value wins on conflict, matching the `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE SET ...`
 * upserts in MetricsCache.swift.
 *
 * Range reads are ORDER BY ts ASC (R-R and events add a secondary key matching Reads.swift),
 * and bound by [from, to] inclusive with a row limit.
