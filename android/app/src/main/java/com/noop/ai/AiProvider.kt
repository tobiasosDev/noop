/**
 * AI Coach providers. The user brings their own API key for one of these and the app
 * sends a compact text summary of their metrics + their question to the chosen provider.
 *
 * Provider names are the only branding shown — there is no app-author / model-vendor
 * branding beyond the provider name the user picks.
 *
 * Wire formats are encoded in [AiCoach]; this enum only carries the display name, the
 * default model, the curated list of selectable models, the chat HTTPS endpoint, and the
 * models-list endpoint used to fetch the provider's live catalogue.
 *
 * The [models] list is a sensible, curated starting point — the user can also fetch the
 * provider's live list (merged in at runtime) or type any model id via "Custom…", so the
 * app never has to ship an exhaustive or up-to-date catalogue.
