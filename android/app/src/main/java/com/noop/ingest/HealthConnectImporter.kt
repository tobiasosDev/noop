/**
 * Native Android Health Connect importer.
 *
 * Reads a fixed set of record types out of the on-device Health Connect store via
 * `androidx.health.connect:connect-client`, aggregates them **per LOCAL calendar day**
 * (the device's default zone), and upserts them into the same Room store the WHOOP/Apple
 * importers write to (see [WhoopRepository]). All timestamps written are wall-clock UNIX
 * **seconds** (Long), matching the rest of the data layer.
 *
 * Device-id mapping (so this co-exists with real WHOOP + Apple Health data):
 *   - Daily "Apple-style" aggregates (steps / calories / VO2max / weight / avg-HR)
 *     -> [AppleDaily] under deviceId "apple-health".
 *   - WHOOP-style autonomic markers (resting-HR / HRV / sleep-minutes / SpO2 / respiration)
 *     -> [DailyMetric] under deviceId "my-whoop", BUT only for days the strap does NOT already
 *     cover — where "cover" means either a raw "my-whoop" daily row OR a computed "my-whoop-noop"
 *     row (the derived recovery/strain/sleep source). Strap data is richer (recovery/strain/
 *     stages), so we never clobber it — we only backfill days the strap left empty. A strap-only
 *     user has NO raw "my-whoop" rows, so the computed source is what marks their days as owned.
 *   - Exercise sessions -> [WorkoutRow] with source "health-connect".
 *
 * Permissions are assumed to have been granted by the UI (via the Health Connect permission
 * flow) BEFORE [import] is called. If Health Connect is unavailable, or the required
 * read permissions are not in fact granted, [import] returns [ImportSummary.failure].
