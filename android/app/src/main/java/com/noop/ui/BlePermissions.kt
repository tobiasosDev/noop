 * Returns a callback that starts a scan, first requesting the runtime Bluetooth permission if it

 * app (Live, Settings, onboarding), so no screen can forget the gate.
 *
 * Why this exists (issue #1): a button that calls `vm.connect()` directly silently no-ops on
 * Android 12+ when the permission was denied or revoked — `startScan()` throws SecurityException,
 * the BLE layer swallows it into a status note, and no prompt is ever shown. The user taps and
 * nothing happens (the exact Pixel 9 report). Requesting the permission *before* connecting fixes
 * that. On grant the launcher calls [onGranted]; on denial, connect() still surfaces the explanatory
 * status note rather than failing silently.
 *
 * This belongs in the Compose layer, not the ViewModel: only an Activity-scoped launcher can raise
 * the system permission dialog. The ViewModel has no launcher and would just re-introduce the
 * silent no-op.
