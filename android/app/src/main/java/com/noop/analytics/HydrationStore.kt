/**
 * HydrationStore — the logging + read seam for the Hydration tracker (MVP, opt-in, local-only).
 *
 * Kotlin twin of the Swift hydration store calls. The day total is banked in the generic metric-series
 * store under the [KEY] series, keyed by the device's LOCAL calendar day — the SAME `metricSeries`
 * table + `WhoopRepository.upsertMetricSeries` path every other generic daily series uses (no schema
 * change). Because that table holds one row per (deviceId, day, key), a tap reads the day's running
 * total and re-upserts total + amount, so the stored value IS "the sum of today's hydration logged for
 * this local day". Everything stays on-device; nothing is synced.
 *
 * `ts` (a wall-clock unix second) selects which local day a log lands on; the goal itself comes from the
 * pure [HydrationGoal] engine, never from here.
