/**
 * Unit tests for [BatteryAlertPolicy], the pure once-per-crossing gate behind the strap low/full
 * battery notifications (#368). The two `*Alerted` flags are PERSISTED, so the policy must be a
 * deterministic function of (pct, charging, lowAlerted, fullAlerted) with no hidden state — that's
 * what lets a battery hovering near a threshold fire exactly once per discharge cycle even across
 * a process restart. Mirrors the macOS BatteryAlertPolicy tests byte-for-byte.
