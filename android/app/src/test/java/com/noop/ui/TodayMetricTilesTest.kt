/**
 * Unit tests for the Today Weight + Steps tile fallback logic (issues #107, #150). The Calories tile
 * reads straight off DailyMetric, so the pure logic worth pinning is the two tiles with an imported
 * fallback source:
 *   - [latestWeightKg] picks the most-recent non-null body weight across the two Apple-side sources.
 *   - [weightTile] prefers that weight, else falls back to the SI profile weight with an honest
 *     "from profile" caption, always formatted through the unit toggle.
 *   - [stepsForDay] resolves the selected day's imported Apple Health / Health Connect step total —
 *     the Steps tile's fallback when the strap (e.g. a WHOOP 4.0) didn't bank an on-device count.
