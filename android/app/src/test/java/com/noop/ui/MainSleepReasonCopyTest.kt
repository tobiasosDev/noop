/**
 * Pins the VERBATIM "why this is your main sleep" copy (COMPONENT 1) the Sleep screen renders for each
 * foundation [SleepStageTotals.MainNightReason] branch, and the {DUR} fill. The strings are a hard
 * cross-platform contract — they MUST be byte-identical to iOS SleepView.mainSleepReasonText, so this
 * guards against an accidental reword on the Kotlin side.
 *
 * [mainSleepReasonText] resolves the reason via [SleepStageTotals.mainNightSelection] using
 * `uiTzOffsetSec()` (the device default tz), so the timezone is pinned to UTC here — making the local
 * time-of-day of each block's midpoint equal its UTC time-of-day, exactly matching the `offsetSec = 0L`
 * foundation fixtures in MainNightConsistencyTest. One case per reason branch + the empty-day null.
